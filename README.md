# CPPI-Algorithm-Backtested-on-Historical-and-Simulated-Data

Built a CPPI algorithem which is avaliable for absolute wealth protection and maximum drawdown restriction.

Backtested the algorithem on historical data where the risky account of CPPI was constructed by Risky Parity Portfolio with three stocks that were loaded through APIs, and the safe account as deposit assuming flat interest rate. 

Backtested on Monte Carlo Simulation where equities as risky assets of CPPI and the simulated data was generated by Geometric Brownian Motion. Safe assets of CPPI were bonds as the by bond pricing algo where interest rate simulated through CIR Model.

Visualised results to show portfolio value growth and histogram of current wealth being left skewed.
